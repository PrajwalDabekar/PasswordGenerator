In my first React.js project, I learned about state and hooks, applying them to create a simple projectâ€”like a counter application. Utilizing `useState` and `useEffect` hooks, I managed data and controlled side effects within functional components. This hands-on experience solidified my understanding of these concepts, offering a foundation for future, more complex projects.
